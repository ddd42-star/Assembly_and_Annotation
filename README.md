# Assembly and Annotation Project

NGS technologies allow researchers to sequence genomes and transcriptomes of almost any organism within a few days. However, the assembly and annotation is still very challenging and requires a deep understanding of assembly algorithms and sequencing technologies.

### Overview
In this course we will assemble and annotate genome from Arabidopsis thaliana. The raw data come from

* Qichao Lian et al. **A pan-genome of 69 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions reveals a conserved genome structure throughout the global species range.** Nature Genetics. 2024;56:982-991. Available from: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01715-9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01715-9)

The accession used for this analysis is *Db-1*

### Datasets

* Whole genome PacBio HiFi reads
* Whole transcriptome Illumina RNA-seq (accession Sha)
